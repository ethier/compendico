Honey: #DCAE1D – In this case the palette is set with the photo and then echoed in the subtitle.

Cerulean: #00303F – Cerulean is incredibly classy as a black or dark grey alternative if used consistently throughout

Mist: #7A9D96 – This clean, natural color is established in the photo but could be used on a lower full-width block or buttons as well.
